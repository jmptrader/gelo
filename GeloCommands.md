GeloCommands is the package `gelo/commands`. It depends on GeloCore and GeloExtensions. It provides a standard library of sorts of prebuilt [alien](GeloTypes#Alien.md) commands, providing basic functionality. It can be [registered with a Gelo VM](UsingTheVM#Adding_items_to_a_VM:_The_Register_*_family.md) wholesale or piecemeal, depending on your needs. Most of the commands are simple manipulations of GeloTypes and the types defined in GeloExtensions. Additionally, it defines a wrapper type around the Go `regexp` package and commands for using regular expressions.
